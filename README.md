# RPG-Go
This is the test framework for a Mobile D&D project.  Let's all hope I don't get bored or frustrated.

Currently I'm developing the underlying classes for character creation.  Next up is developing a flexible "effects" system that allows for the myriad of race, class, spell, item (etc) effects.

This Visual Studio Community solution includes two projects.
## RPG_Go
This is the main repository for the library itself.  The project type is class library and the compatibility is set to .Net 3.5., so welcome to 2008.  This project will be copied into the Assets folder of any unity project I use it with.  There's probably some gitful way to do this automatically but I don't know it.


## Constantine
is the console test environment.
